d and dset type specifications:

d is a list of dsets referenced by a number starting in 0

a dset is a list of drules

a drule is a dictionary X => Y where
    X is 'rname', 'prod', 'nsymbols', 'dot' or 'slash'
    Y depends on the value of X:
    'rname' => Y is a string representing the name of the variable
    'prod' => Y is a set of strings representing a production for that variable
    'nsymbols' => Y is an int representing the number of symbols in the production
    'dot' => Y is an int representing the position of the dot in the production
    'slash' => Y is an int representing the value of the '/n' in the end of the drule
